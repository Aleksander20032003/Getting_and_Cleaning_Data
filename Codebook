The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals ("Time-") were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 

Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. 
(ex. Time-BodyAccelerationJerk, Time-BodyAccelerationJerk). 

Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(ex. Time-BodyGyroscopeMagnitude)

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing ("Frequency-")
(ex. Frequency-BodyAcceleration)
 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean ("mean()" ) and standard deviation ("-std()")for each measurement.
